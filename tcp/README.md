==================

The purpose of this assignment is to:

* learn how to establish and maintain TCP connections
* learn how distributed dynamic routing protocols accomplish packet routing
* implement a link state routing protocol

Included Files
--------------

1. routed_LS.c
2. test
3. ports
4. makefile
5. README.txt (this file)

Commands
--------
### To Run the Program ###

1. Create the executable `routed_LS` with the following command:  

	  	make

2. Run the test script to see the program in action.

   	    ./test

3. While test is running run the ports script to see the connections being used.

   		./ports

### Other Useful Commands ###

1. `make clean` to create clean workspace.

Notes
-----

Since we couldn't get the TCP connections working, the rest of the program also failed. We did however flush out that code so if we did get it working, the rest might of worked.

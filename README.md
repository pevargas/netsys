### `udp/`

*User Datagram Protocol Assignment*:
  The purpose of this program is to create a simple udp socket between a client and a server program.

#### Notes
  With three minutes to spare, I was able to turn it in. I was able to get the basic program working, such as the `ls` and `exit` command. The `get` and `put` commands do work. With a text file, there is no problem. With the three minutes to spare, I discovered I was using the wrong functions to implment binary file transfer. If I had more time, I believe I could have completed the assignemnt. Perhaps I will in the future, if time permits.
